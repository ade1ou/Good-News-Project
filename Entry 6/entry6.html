    <h1>Medical Miracles: Thank You COVID?</h1>
    <p>Scientific breakthroughs in medicine are booming. From the rediscovery of the body’s ‘forgotten organ’ to potential cures for cancers, Alzheimer’s and HIV on the horizon, we are entering a bold new era of medicine. These discoveries could be as revolutionary as the arrival of anesthesia in the 1840s or the discovery of the first antibiotic penicillin in 1928.
        </p>
    <p>Many doctors and researchers in the medical field such as Bertalan Mesko, director of the Medical Futurist Institute in Budapest are arguing that the world is on the brink of a new ‘golden age’ of medicine. And it’s thanks, in part, to Covid-19.</p>

          <p class="columntext">“Breakthroughs in mRNA technology first applied in Covid vaccines could soon help eradicate certain types of cancer,” Mesko explains. “Then there’s the huge potential of AI and 3D printing and, most excitingly, advances in genomics, which will unlock the genetic bases of many diseases, leading to new and more targeted treatments. 

            We’re seeing a pace of progress in medicine that has not been witnessed for 100 years. While AI may have many dangers and pose threats to job sectors in law and finance, its applications in medicine is much sunnier, according to Chris Stokel-Walker,

            “AI will supercharge the pace of novel drug discoveries, including much-needed antibiotics [as resistance increases],” he explains. “Plus [the technology] can analyze and identify issues such as tumors in scans more effectively than humans can.” AI will also radically reduce doctors’ day-to-day administration around documentation, prescribing and screening for common conditions.
            
            “This will free up time for doctors to do what’s at the core of their job: helping patients,” says Stokel-Walker.

            <p class="columntext">Soon, you can expect to see breakthroughs in treating some of the most recalcitrant conditions of old age: a ‘gene-silencing’ treatment for Alzheimer’s, for example, and wearable diagnostics that will give early warnings of metabolic disease, strokes and heart attacks, reducing disablement and improving patient outcomes. For younger people, you can also look forward to revolutionary stem cell therapies for infertility and therapeutics targeting the body’s ‘forgotten organ’, the microbiome. </p>

    <h1>Medical Miracles: Thank You COVID?</h1>
    <p>Scientific breakthroughs in medicine are booming. From the rediscovery of the body’s ‘forgotten organ’ to potential cures for cancers, Alzheimer’s and HIV on the horizon, we are entering a bold new era of medicine. These discoveries could be as revolutionary as the arrival of anesthesia in the 1840s or the discovery of the first antibiotic penicillin in 1928.
        </p>
    <p>Many doctors and researchers in the medical field such as Bertalan Mesko, director of the Medical Futurist Institute in Budapest are arguing that the world is on the brink of a new ‘golden age’ of medicine. And it’s thanks, in part, to Covid-19.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <p class="columntext">“Breakthroughs in mRNA technology first applied in Covid vaccines could soon help eradicate certain types of cancer,” Mesko explains. “Then there’s the huge potential of AI and 3D printing and, most excitingly, advances in genomics, which will unlock the genetic bases of many diseases, leading to new and more targeted treatments. 

            We’re seeing a pace of progress in medicine that has not been witnessed for 100 years. While AI may have many dangers and pose threats to job sectors in law and finance, its applications in medicine is much sunnier, according to Chris Stokel-Walker,

            “AI will supercharge the pace of novel drug discoveries, including much-needed antibiotics [as resistance increases],” he explains. “Plus [the technology] can analyze and identify issues such as tumors in scans more effectively than humans can.” AI will also radically reduce doctors’ day-to-day administration around documentation, prescribing and screening for common conditions.
            
            “This will free up time for doctors to do what’s at the core of their job: helping patients,” says Stokel-Walker.

For younger people, you can also look forward to revolutionary stem cell therapies for infertility and therapeutics targeting the body’s ‘forgotten organ’, the microbiome. </p>

While existing drugs clear the proteins once they are already present, excitement is building about a new treatment that stops the toxic proteins from being produced in the first place. </p>

                Malaria kills an estimated 400,000 people each year, mostly children under the age of five. Last century, 2-5% of all deaths were from malaria, according to one estimate. Despite this huge toll, vaccines for this historic killer, which is caused by parasites carried by mosquitoes, have proved elusive due to the culprit parasites’ complex life cycle and high level of mutations.

                Traditional vaccines rely on injecting part of a virus, or a weakened virus, into a human body in an approach that hasn’t changed since Jenner’s 18th century experiments with cowpox. First used during the Covid-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines instead deliver a genetic code that our bodies can use to make the relevant piece of viral protein ourselves.

                In 2013, Lawrence Bonassar of Cornell University, New York, used 3D scans of human ears to 3D print a human outer ear from bovine cartilage cells suspended in collagen. It was an early breakthrough in a technology that could lead to personalised 3D-printed heart valves and blood vessels, as well as the ability for surgeons to print new bone tissue into the region where it is needed during surgery.

                Can our genes be ? That’s the potential of Crispr, a gene-editing technology first discovered in the 1980s. Scientists found that a unique single-celled organism could splice the DNA of alien viruses into its own genome (to mount an immune response in case of future infection). In 2012, Crispr was adapted to edit segments of human genes by a team at the University of California.

Germline stem cells are a specialised type of stem cell (the miracle human cells that are able to develop into anything from muscle to brain cells).

        <h1>Macron announces on Twitter/X</h1>
        <p>In a delightful turn of events, President Emmanuel Macron of France has unleashed a proposal that might just make France the coolest kid on the block when it comes to women's rights. Macron has declared on social media that by next year “the right of women to choose abortion will become irreversible.”

      <p>This push comes in direct response to the restriction of abortion rights in the United States. Abortion in France has not been similarly under threat. The French public overwhelmingly supports abortion rights. Abortion is legal for any reason through the 14th week of pregnancy and fully covered by the country’s health insurance system.</p>
      <p>But after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade last year and allowed states to outlaw abortion, French women clamored to further protect their right.</p>
      <p>In many countries, abortion is protected by law, not court decision.</p>

            <p class="smalltext">“The Dobbs case was very shocking in France,” said Mathilde Philip-Gay, a law professor at Jean Moulin Lyon 3 University. “A movement was born just after the case, and women asked Parliament to act and especially to change the constitution.” She noted that polls in the summer of 2022 showed that about 80 percent of the population supported abortion rights and a similar percentage was in favor of adding a right to abortion to the constitution.</p>

           <p class="smalltext">Stéphanie Hennette Vauchez, a law professor at the University of Paris Nanterre, said there are other countries whose constitutions gesture toward reproductive autonomy or the right to make decisions regarding children, “but there’s no constitution that really expressly protects a right to abortion.”

            “It also opens up really interesting theoretical questions about why have constitutions been so silent about human reproduction while, you know, all political communities depend existentially on reproduction,” she said. “If France or another country were to write the right to abortion in the constitution, it would really be a pioneering move.”</p>

    <p class="cloudtext">There have been disagreements over the precise wording, with lawmakers arguing over whether abortion should be a “right” or “freedom”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="padding"></div>
<p>Regardless however, the law could inspire other countries to move towards the right direction regarding women’s reproductive rights. Macron’s office confirmed Friday that he had submitted a draft reflecting the “freedom” language favored by the more conservative Senate. The proposed text, to be added to Article 34 of the constitution, says: “The law determines the conditions under which a woman’s freedom is exercised, which is guaranteed to her, to have recourse to an abortion.” That text could still be amended by lawmakers before they vote on it.</p>
<p>Feminist groups have argued that a “right” would be more robust than a “freedom” and would more clearly confer an obligation on the government to provide access. Some advocates are also concerned that the proposed wording gives too much power to the legislators of the day and might not prevent any rollback of protections.</p>
<p>The fine-tuning of language may seem like a luxury to abortion rights activists in the United States, who have been fighting bans and other steps to limit access in various states, where abortion is legal, under threat, of completely banned.</p>
<p>So, let's raise a croissant to the French initiative to put the 'freedom to choose' right where it belongs, in the constitution🥐🇫🇷✌️<p>

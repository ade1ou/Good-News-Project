    <h1>It’s not as bad as it looks!</h1>
    <p>Wars in the Middle East, famine in central Africa, global warming, fake news, AI destroying the world, and a pandemic creeping back all on your average Tuesday, its hard not to feel discouraged about the state of the world.</p>

    <p>In 1920, just over a hundred years ago, the average American (mostly women, since men just wore the nasty clothes anyway) spent an average of 11.5 hours a week doing laundry. By 2014, the number dropped to 1.5 hours a week, thanks the the amazing Hans Roaling invention from the Industrial Revolution: the washing machine. By freeing up time people used to use washing laundry by hand, this technology allowed people to devote more time to educating clean non non-stinky children, and allowed women to cultivate their careers.

    <p>Pinker suggests that the view of the world we get from journalists is much more pessimistic than what the data is actually showing on a macro scale. What happens, is that good things happen slowly, a few percentage points a year, but they compound to great achievements, while bad things are happening all the time, and usually in shorter time spans or events, easy to turn into an eye-catching and devastating headline on the New York Times.

        <p>As seen in the most recent UN News article is “Over 330 million children worldwide living in extreme poverty”. While that is undoutebtly an immense figure, looking at the current stats, today it is estimated that 8-9% of the world population is living in poverty, compare this to 200 years ago when the number was 90%.</p>

    <p>As Steven Pinker put it: “Journalism has a built-in bias toward the negative, because bad things are sudden and newsworthy (a shooting rampage, a war, an epidemic), while good things are gradual and boring (a crime decline, a spreading peace, a longevity rise). The culture of journalists amplifies the negativity by dismissing positive developments as human interest fluff, corporate PR or government propaganda.”
    </p>
    <p>So, I urge you to look out for the negative biases in the latest newspapers and reports. Try and put those headlines of the day to day into perspective, and counter systematic pessimism in journalistic practices. By looking at data instead of the headlines, you can become aware of the incremental but important improvements on the climate, political atmosphere, social well being all across the globe.</p>

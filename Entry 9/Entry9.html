      </div>  
  <div class="margins">
      <p>Virgin Atlantic has been granted permission to operate the first transatlantic flight powered by 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The airline’s boss has labelled this a “historic” flight that has taken more than a year to put in place. The Civil Aviation Authority said it has approved the flight, which is due to take place from London Heathrow to New York‘s JFK Airport on 28 November.</p>

    

      <p>SAF is produced from sustainable sources such as agricultural waste and used cooking oil. For this flight, a Boeing 787 will be filled with 50 tonnes of SAF. Two types are being used, with 88% derived from waste fats and the rest from the wastes of corn production in the US.</p>
      <p>Following test and analysis, the flight was approved by UK regulator the Civil Aviation Authority earlier this month. A number of companies have been involved in the project including engine-maker Rolls-Royce and energy giant BP.</p>

      <div class="padding"></div>
      <h1>Sky High Sustainability</h1>
    
      <p>Currently, SAF is already used in small amounts, blended with traditional jet fuel, but accounts for less than 0.1% of the aviation fuel consumed around the world. The aviation industry is seen as particularly difficult to decarbonise, but airline bosses view SAF as the single most effective way to bring its net emissions down to zero.</p>
      <p>Planes still emit carbon when using SAF, but the industry says the "lifecycle emissions" of these fuels can be up to 70% lower than traditional jet fuel. </p>
    </div>
  
      <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="column">
      <p>However, it is currently several times more expensive to produce. SAF can currently be used in jet engines to a maximum blend of 50% with kerosene without the need for any modifications. CAA chief executive Rob Bishton said: “As the UK’s aviation regulator, it’s important that we safely enable the industry to embrace more sustainable practices and push the boundaries of what’s possible to create a greener aviation industry. 
    </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
    <p>“This permit not only allows Virgin Atlantic and others to showcase their commitment to sustainability, but also serves as an example of how the industry is always exploring new technologies. Innovation and sustainability are vital areas of work, but they must go hand in hand with safety. “This is a reminder that together we can drive change, reduce emissions and make the skies greener for generations to come.”</p>

    <p>Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: “The world’s journey to decarbonising flight starts here in the UK, with today’s announcement helped by Government funding so people can continue to travel how they want, in a way that’s fit for the future.</p>
    <div class="padding"></div>
    <h1>Green Skies Ahead</h1>
   
    <p>“By turning waste materials into the fuel of the future that will power our aviation sector, it’s UK innovation that is leading the way with the world’s first transatlantic 100 per cent SAF-powered flight.”

        Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss said: “The Civil Aviation Authority’s permit to fly Flight100 marks a key milestone and a huge achievement for all the teams working towards this historic flight.
        
        “Getting to this point has been more than a year in the making and taken radical collaboration across our consortium partners and Government. We’re committed to using 10 per cent SAF by 2030, but to get there we need the government to support the creation of a UK SAF industry. We know that if we can make it, we can fly it.”</p>
